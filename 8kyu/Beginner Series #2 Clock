function past(h, m, s){
  //#Happy Coding! ^_^
 
  //This was the first attempt
  //var millisec;
  // millisec = (h*60*60*1000) + (m*60*1000) + (s*1000);
  //return millisec;
  
  
  //This was the second attempt, I cleaned it up
  var ms;
  m = m + (h*60);// convert hours to minutes and add to current minutes
  s = s + (m*60);//convert minutes to seconds and add current seconds
  ms = s*1000;//convert seconds to milliseconds
  
  return ms;//return the answer
